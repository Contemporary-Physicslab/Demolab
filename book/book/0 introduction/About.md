# About this book

This book started off with a collection of pdf's from the '90s. We considered this a valuable but outdated and static archive. We envisioned an updated online and dynamic repository of physics demonstrations which is accessible to all. By utilizing [GitHub](https://github.com) we would enable others to contribute, allow them to offer suggestions, fix bugs, while maintaining version control and ensuring quality. Our ultimate goal was to create a ‘living’, ‘ever-growing’ repository where the quality of the demonstrations is continuously enhanced through active contributions from fellow educators, see {ref}`fig_infograph`.

Our approach to creating a living, ever-growing repository.

Hence we set to work, converted the pdf's to markdown files (the work of Luuk Fröling) and creating a first [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). All drawings were remade, resulting in high-quality vector drawings (the work of Hanna den Hertog). New pictures and video's were made (with the help of Tom Haanstra). Where possible, python codes where added, allowing for simulations and data-analysis. This resulted in this book 'The Demonstration Laboratory'. 

We consider the book not finished, it is not intended in that way. We believe that the book should be regarded as an output of a dynamic repository. We can add and change demonstrations, improve the quality of descriptions, add code, and so on. You may contribute to this, and will be recognized for it! 


## Your contribution

You can contribute to this book in various ways: 
1. Enhance the quality by making comments and doing suggestions using the issue button <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> below the  <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> button.
2. Add content

If you see a typo, if something is not clear, or anything needs to be adjusted, click the <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> button at the top of the screen and open an issue by clicking on the {fa}`lightbulb` button. (You need to have a github account though). We then get a notification and address the issue as soon as possible.

If you have want to add your material, you can do so by [contacting us](c.f.j.pols@tudelft.nl). You can become a team-member of the github repository and are allowed to add materials. If you are interested how this work, see the [teachbooks manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/workflows/collaboration.html) on the matter.
