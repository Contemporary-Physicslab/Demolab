# About this book

This book started off with a collection of pdf's from the '90s. We considered this a valuable but outdated and static archive. We envisioned an updated online and dynamic repository of physics demonstrations which is accessible to all. By utilizing [GitHub](https://github.com) we would enable others to contribute, allow them to offer suggestions, fix bugs, while maintaining version control and ensuring quality. Our ultimate goal was to create a ‘living’, ‘ever-growing’ repository where the quality of the demonstrations is continuously enhanced through active contributions from fellow educators, see {ref}`fig_infograph`.

Our approach to creating a living, ever-growing repository.

Hence we set to work, converted the pdf's to markdown files (the work of Luuk Fröling) and creating a first [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). All drawings were remade, resulting in high-quality vector drawings (the work of Hanna den Hertog). New pictures and video's were made (with the help of Tom Haanstra). This resulted in this book 'The Demonstration Laboratory'.
