# Workflow

Our ultimate goal is to create a ‘living’, ‘ever-growing’ repository where the quality of the demonstrations is continuously enhanced through active contributions from fellow educators. By leveraging GitHub, we collaborate with others, ensure quality whilst expanding the list of demonstrations and making all materials open access available (complying to the FAIR principles as well).

You can contribute to this book in various ways: 
1. Enhancing the quality by making comments and doing suggestions using the issue button.
2. Add content

## Create issue
If you see a typo, if something is not clear, or anything needs to be adjusted, click the <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> button at the top of the screen and open an issue by clicking on the {fa}`lightbulb` button. (You need to have a github account though). We then get a notification and address the issue as soon as possible.

## Add content
