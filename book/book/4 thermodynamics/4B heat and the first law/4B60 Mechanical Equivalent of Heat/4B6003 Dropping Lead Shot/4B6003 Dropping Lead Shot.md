## Equipment   
- A 1 meter long perspex tube filled with 0.100 kg lead shot, and a thermistor mounted inside the tube.
- Data acquisition to display the temperature reading (PASCO).
   
  
## Presentation   
The tube is rotated over 180 degrees, such that the lead shot drops from one end of the tube to the other end (see the enlarged {numref}`Figure {number} <4b6003/figure_4B60.03b.jpg>`).

The temperature is displayed real time (see the brown rim in {numref}`Figure {number} <4b6003/figure_4B60.03c.jpg>`). Additionaly the students can observe the temperature rise that the thermistor registers.
  
## Explanation   
This demonstration just illustrates the conversion of mechanical energy into heat energy.

An easy calculation can give an estimate of the temperature rise:

Suppose just before hitting that the steel ball has a speed of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$. Then an amount of (kinetic) energy of $\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 2^{2}=4 \mathrm{~J}$ oules can be transformed into heat.

The point of contact between the two spheres is very small. Suppose it has an area of around $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. Since the paper used is $80 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, the considered piece of paper between the two spheres has a mass of 0.8 milligram.

Now the local temperature rise of the paper between the spheres can be calculated, knowing that the specific heat of paper (c) is around $2.5 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K} . \mathrm{kg}: \Delta T=\frac{Q}{m c}$, $Q$ being the amount of heat that is induced without a loss by the transformation of the kinetic energy into heat. This leads to $\Delta T=\frac{4}{0.8 \times 10^{-6} 2.5 \times 10^{3}}=2000$ Kelvin.

Paper inflames at around $232^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (" 451 Fahrenheit"; Ray Bradbury), so the paper will certainly inflame (we suppose of course that all kinetic energy is transformed into heat into the paper with no losses).

This calculation is just an estimate. Supposing the area a little larger, for instance $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, will lead to a temperature rise of "only" 200 Kelvin. And this is not enough to inflame the paper.  
  
## Remarks
 *  Give the spheres high speed! In practice we notice that the spheres need a high speed to produce the burning of the paper. When the speed is too low just a deformation of the paper can be observed. This experience shows that the estimation of temperature rise made in the Explanation is not too bad.
