# 02 Lorentz Force (1)  
  
## Aim   
 To show that a current in a magnetic field experiences a force.    
  
## Subjects

## Equipment
 *  Spiral filament lamp. 
 *  Safety connector to mains ($220\mathrm{~V}/50\mathrm{~Hz}$). 
 *  Bar magnet.
    
  
## Presentation   
The lamp is connected to the mains and the filament is glowing. The filament can be seen clearly.

The bar magnet approaches the lamp and the individual turns of the spiral filament show themselves as broadened bands (see {numref}`Figure {number} <5h4002_figure_1.png>`). The filament performs a fast reciprocating motion    
  
## Explanation   
The reciprocating motion of the filament indicates that a force is acting and that it is acting to and fro."To and fro" is caused by the constantly changing direction of the current ( $50 \mathrm{~Hz}$ ).
