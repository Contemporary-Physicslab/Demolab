# 01 Who is the Strongest in a Collision? 
 
  
## Aim   
 To show that Action=-Reaction is always true.    
  
## Subjects   
* 1H10 (Action and Reaction)

## Equipment
- Track, $2.2 \mathrm{~m}$.
- Two collision carts
- Two force sensors, one of them mounted with a spring.
- Mass, $1 \mathrm{~kg}$.
- Interface and data-acquisition system (we use PASCO ScienceWorkshop).
- Projector to project on the monitor screen.
    
  
## Presentation   
Presentation: The force sensors are attached to each cart and connected to the interface (see Diagram). The software is prepared to read and graphically display both forces $(-1$ to $+12 \mathrm{~N})$ during about $10 \mathrm{~s}$. Both carts are positioned on the track at about $5 \mathrm{~m}$ away from each other. The data recording is started, and both carts are pushed towards each other manually. The recording is stopped after a collision occurs. Students can now observerve the registered force data (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1h1001_figure_1.png>` left).

The part of the data that resembles the collision is magnified (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1h1001_figure_1.png>` right). It can be seen that at any moment, the force on both carts is the same. $1 \mathrm{~kg}$ is added to one of the carts. The demonstration is repeated, again showing that the forces registered during the collision are the same at all times both carts!    
  
## Explanation   
Newton's third law states $\vec{F}_{A \rightarrow B}=-\vec{F}_{B \rightarrow A}$, which is supported by the results of these demonstrations.   
  
## Remarks
- The speed you give the carts by hand is, of course, not important. But when students doubt, redo a run with one cart standing still or moving at a different speed in the same direction. The data-registration will always show $\vec{F}_{A \rightarrow B}=-\vec{F}_{B \rightarrow A}$.
- In the right graph of {numref}`Figure {number} <1h1001_figure_1.png>` can be seen which cart has the spring mounted to its force sensor: A damped vibration is seen after the collision. The force sensor itself also vibrates after the collision, as shown in the graph of the other force sensor.
