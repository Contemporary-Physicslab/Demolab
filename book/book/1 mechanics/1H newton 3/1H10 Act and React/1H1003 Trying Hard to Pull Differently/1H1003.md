# 03 Trying Hard to Pull Differently 

## Aim   
 To show (again) the validity of Newton's third law.    
  
## Subjects

## Equipment   
 *  Two force sensors. 
 *  Rubber band. 
 *  Data acquisition via Science Workshop. 
 *  Projector to project on the monitor screen
 *  Trying hard to pull differently
    
  
## Presentation   
On the monitor, two graphs are presented for each force sensor. The software is set in such a way that one of the sensors presents $-F$.

Two demonstrators take each of the sensors. They start both pulling randomly. The display shows clearly that whatever they do, both force sensors measure the same force: $-F$ and $-F$ (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1h1003_figure_1.png>`).

```

Also, when one of the demonstrators holds his force sensor without moving it, while the other demonstrator moves again randomly, then both force sensors register an equal $F$ and $-F$. The registration does not reveal which of the two demonstrators is not moving his sensor.   
  
## Explanation   
 Again, the validity of Newton's third law is shown.
