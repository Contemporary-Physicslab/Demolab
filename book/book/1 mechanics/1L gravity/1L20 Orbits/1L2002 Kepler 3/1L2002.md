# 02 Kepler's Third Law 
    
## Aim   
 To show empirically that Kepler’s third law is true.

## Equipment   
 *  Graph on overhead sheet, $T=f(a)$, $T$ and a both scaled logarithmically. 
 *  Table with data of the planetary system (see Sources). 
  
## Presentation   
 The graph is projected by means of an overhead sheet. The relationship with the table of planetary data is elucidated. Clearly can be observed that the data fit on a straight line in such a double logarithmic graph. The slope of this line ($p/q$) equals 1.5. This is the relationship of the powers in Kepler's third law: $T^2\propto a^3$
  
## Explanation   
 Kepler's third law states  $T^2=c \times a^3$ with $c$ a constant. Taking logarithms on both sides, we can also write:

 $$2\log T = \log c + 3\log a$$ 

 and:

 $$\log T = \frac{1}{2}\log c + \frac{3}{2}\log a$$
 
 So when T and a are graphed logarithmically (with $x$– and $y$-decades equally spaced), we see a line whose slope ($\frac{3}{2}$) is the power-relationship in the original function.   
  
## Simulations   
 <!-- On the internet you can find many simulations that are appropriate. For instance on: www.walter-fendt.de , www.physics.sjsu.edu/Tomley/demos.htm and www.astro.unl.edu/naap/pos/animations/kepler.swf .    -->
