# 03 Coriolis (1b) 

## Aim   
To show the effect on an object moving with constant velocity in a rotating reference frame.    
  
## Subjects   
* 1E20 (Rotating Reference Frames) 
* 1E30 (Coriolis Effect)

## Equipment   
- Rotating platform.
- Board, with square grid $\left(10 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$.
- Tripod with camera fixed to rotating platform.
- Large tripod to hold cables to the camera (see Diagram).
- Clamping material.
  
## Safety   
 
 *  Take care not to rotate too many times in one direction, as this can cause the camera cables to become excessively twisted.

This demonstration is equal to [Coriolis](../1E2002%20Coriolis/1E2002.md). The difference is that now the camera presents directly to the audience what is observed on the rotating platform.

Again, show that the steel ball follows a straight line in the lecture hall's frame of reference, while the camera shows a curved path.

Rotate the platform in both directions. 
  
## Explanation   
$\vec{F}_{\text {cor }}=2 m\left(\bar{v}^{'} \times \bar{\omega}\right) . \vec{v}^{'}$ and $\bar{\omega}$ are continuously perpendicular to each other. {numref}`Figure {number} <1e2003_figure_1.png>` shows the direction of the resulting $F_{\text {cor }}$. So $F_{\text {cor }}$ points as seen from $\vec{v}^{'}$ continuously to the left, giving $m$ a counter clockwise path.

When the platform rotates into the other direction, in Figure $1 \bar{\omega}$ will point upward, and the resulting $\vec{F}_{\text {cor }}$ will be in the opposite direction.
