# 01 Super Balls, Double Ball Drop 
    
## Aim   

Showing that when a small ball resting on top of a larger ball is dropped from a low height, the small ball ideally rebounds to nearly nine times its original height.

## Equipment   

*  1 larger ball (basketball). 
*  1 smaller ball (table-tennis ball). 
*  Astro-superball
    

## Presentation   
A smaller ball is dropped and bounces almost to the original dropping height. Next the smaller ball is held on top of the larger ball. This combination is dropped simultaneously and now, after striking the floor, the small ball takes off and can reach a height nine times as high as the original dropping height.   

It may help to repeat the experiment but then with the small ball about $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the larger ball.

## Explanation   

Just before striking the floor both balls have a velocity $v$. Just after the combination hits the floor, the larger ball moves up with a velocity $v$ whereas the smaller ball is still moving down with a velocity $v$, making the two balls relative speed $2 v$. So, the smaller ball is approaching the larger ball with a velocity of $2 v$. When the collision is elastic, the velocity of the small ball after the collision is again $2 v$, but now in the opposite direction. So the smaller ball moves away from the larger ball with a velocity $2 v$. Relative to the floor, the larger ball moves up with a velocity $v$, so the smaller ball moves up with a velocity $3 v$ relative to the floor. (See {numref}`Figure {number} <1e1001/figure_1.png>`)

```

The small ball would have gone up with a velocity $v$ if it had just hit the floor, but now it takes off with a velocity $3v$. Because $m g h=1 / 2 m v^{2}$, a 3 times higher take-off velocity means that it goes 9 times higher!


## Remarks

*   Do not rest the table-tennis ball on the basketball and drop it as such a combination. When this is done, the table-tennis ball stays fixed to the basketball (aerodynamic reason) and for this demonstration it is needed that on hitting the ground there is some distance between the two balls. 
*   It is recommended that the dropping of the balls is practiced, especially dropping the small and large ball simultaneously. 
*   An extension of the demonstration is to drop a stack of three or even more balls (See {numref}`Figure {number} <1e1001/figure_X.png>`). When a three-ball combination is dropped, the top ball approaches a maximum of 49 times the initial release height. In order to drop the Astroball-stack perfectly vertical, wet your fingers holding the stack and slowly let it slip away. 
*   The experiment does not perform very well on a wooden floor.
