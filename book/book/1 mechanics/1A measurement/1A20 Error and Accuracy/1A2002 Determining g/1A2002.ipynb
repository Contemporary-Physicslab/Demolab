    "Every measurement can only be done with a certain precision. Sometimes the precision is determined by the equipment, and sometimes by the property you are measuring. In science, the answer is always given with the associated uncertainty, where the chance that a repeated measurement falls within the value with its associated uncertainty is equal to 68% ($P(\\bar{x}-\\mu_x<x<\\bar{x}+\\mu_x)=0.68$). When multiple quantities play a role, as in the determination of the acceleration due to gravity, each measurement contributes. The final value of the uncertainty in this equation is given by:\n",
