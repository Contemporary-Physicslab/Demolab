## Equipment

- Tube, with rounded edges, $l=15 \mathrm{~cm}$.
- Piece of rope, $l=1.5 \mathrm{~m}$.
- Two rubber stoppers $\left(m_{1}\right)$.
- A number of weights $\left(m_{2}\right)$. We use thick washers.
- Paperclip.
- (Stopwatch).
  

## Presentation   

{numref}`Figure {number} <1d5001/figure_0.png>` shows the components and how to use them. Swinging the tube a little makes the mass $m_{1}$ go round in circles above your head. The demonstrator needs to make $m_{1}$ go round at a certain frequency to balance the system.

- When lowering the frequency, $m_{2}$ will move down making the circle of $m_{1}$ smaller and smaller. Speeding up makes $m_{2}$ go upward and $m_{1}$ goes round in larger and larger circles.
- The demonstrator makes $m_{1}$ go round in a stable circle, then grabs $m_{2}$ and pulls it downwards. $m_{1}$ speeds up significantly, going round in smaller and smaller circles. 

The relationship between the variables in this demonstration can be verified. Just below the tubing a paperclip is fixed to the rope used as a marker to make $m_{1}$ go round in a circle with fixed $R$. A stopwatch can be used to time the frequency. 

1. When $m_{1}$ is doubled by adding another rubber stopper to it, a lower frequency is needed to balance the system.
2. When $m_{2}$ is increased, a higher frequency is needed to balance the system.
3. When half the rope length is used (shifting the paperclip) a higher frequency is needed to balance the system.     
  

## Explanation   

The circular motion with radius $R$ at constant speed $v$ of a mass $m_{1}$ can be described by $a_{c}=\frac{v^{2}}{r} \omega^{2} R$. In our demonstration the tension $T$ in the string provides the force needed for $a_{c}$: $T=m_{1} a_{c}$, and $m_{2} g=m_{1} a_{c} \Rightarrow a_{c}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} g$, (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1d5001/figure_2.png>`).

- First, the demonstrator showed a balanced situation. When decreasing $\omega$, the centripetal acceleration, is decreasing: $\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right)$. But as $T$ is a fixed value, $T$ will pull $m_{1}$ inward. As $a_{c}=\omega^{2} R$ shows, this proces is cumulative and $m_{1}$ ends at the centre of the circle.
- When $m_{2}$ is pulled downwards, the string tension increases substantially and therefore $a_{c}$. According to $a_{c}=\omega^{2} R$ and seeing that $R$ decreases, $\omega$ increases.

1. Doubling $m_{1}$ means that the provided $a_{c}$ by the tension of the string will be halved $\left(a_{c}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} g\right)$. To make $m_{1}$ still go round in the same circle $\omega$ has to be a factor $\sqrt{2}$ lower $\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right)$.
2. Increasing $m_{2}$ will increase the string tension and so the provided $a_{c}$ increases $\left(T=m_{1} a_{c}\right)$.  To keep $R$ constant, $\omega$ has to increase.
3. When $R$ is halved, the tension in the string has remained the same, so the provided $a_{c}$ has remained the same. To make $m_{1}$ still go in a (smaller) circle, $\omega$ has to increase a factor $\sqrt{2}\left(a_{c}=\omega^{2} R\right)$.

  
## Remarks 

- Practice before showing. A practiced hand is needed to make $m_{1}$ go round properly.
- We use rubber stoppers as masses for safety reasons.
- The spinning mass should be light compared to the hanging weight (about a factor 3), because otherwise the angle between the string and the vertical does not approach $90^{\circ}$: there will be more friction and due to the slanting rope (making a cone of our circle) the analysis becomes a different one.
- In the last part of the presentation (grabbing and pulling $m_{2}$ downwards) the demonstrator will feel that quite a lot of force is needed. It is most instructive for the students if they feel this force themselves (during coffee break?).
