## Equipment   
 *  Conical beaker, $2 \text{l}$, filled with water. 
 *  Rubber stop. 
 *  Ping-pong ball tied to rubber stop (see Diagram).   
  
## Safety   
 
 *  The conical beaker filled with water is quite heavy ($m \approx 2\text{kg}$). Hold it firmly!
     
  
## Presentation   
 Hold the conical beaker filled with water upside-down in your hands. The ping-pong ball stands vertically above the rubber stop. Make yourself turn in a circle and while turning observe the ping-pong ball (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1d5003/figure_1.png>`).

The ping-pong ball is displaced towards you.    
  
## Explanation   
The ping-pong ball being completely immersed in water experiences an upward thrust $F_{u}$ that is larger than its weight $m\cdot g$. The net force ($F_{u}-m\cdot g$ ) is directed upwards. The tension $T$ in the string prevents that the ping-pong ball floats upwards (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1d5003/figure_2.png>`a).

When turning around in circles the ping-pong ball is forced to move in a circle. A centripetal force is needed for that. {numref}`Figure {number} <1d5003/figure_2.png>`b shows the new situation of equilibrium: the net upward force and tension are compensated by a centripetal force $F_{c}$. Any other position of the ping-pong ball is not a situation of equilibrium (drawing a free body diagram of the forces will show this).

## Remarks
 *  When an air-bubble is trapped in the conical beaker filled with water, this bubble will behave in the same way as the ping-pong ball does. 
 *  When you move the system from left to right, the acceleration on the left side and the deceleration on the right side can be observed. In general: the system can be used as an acceleration-meter.
