# 03 Student's Centre of Mass 
  
## Aim   

To show that the centre of mass ($CM$) will not move when only internal forces act.    
  

## Subjects   

* 1D40 (Motion of the Center of Mass)

## Equipment    

*  Two light carts (skateboards), easy rolling. 
*  Rope, $l=10\mathrm{~m}$. 
*  Light student. 
*  Heavy student.


## Presentation   

The two carts are situated in front of the lecture hall, one on the right side, the other left. The two students (volunteers) stand each on their own cart; they hold the rope. Knowing the students' masses, the $CM$ can be determined. This position is marked on the floor. Now one of the students (or both) gently hauls in the rope. The carts will hit approximately at the $CM$.    

  
## Explanation   

Explanation: The CM of a system of particles represents the average position of those particles. So, seen from the CM: 

$$m_{1} r_{1}+m_{2} r_{2}+\ldots=0$$

The larger the mass $(m)$, the smaller $r$ will be. Since there are no external forces acting, the CM will not be displaced as this demonstration verifies.
