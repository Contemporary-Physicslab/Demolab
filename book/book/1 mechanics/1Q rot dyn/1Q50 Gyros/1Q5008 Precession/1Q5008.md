## Equipment
 *  bicycle wheel with handles 
 *  1 piece of rope 
 *  1 stick
    
  
## Presentation   
The wheel is rotating and held by a string. The rotating wheel has an angle of about $45^{\circ}-60^{\circ}$ with the vertical. The wheel will precess about a vertical axis. When the instructor pushes with the side of his hands or a stick against one of the handles of the wheel in the direction of precession, then the rotating wheel will rise to a more vertical position. This can be continued, even passing the vertical.  
  
## Explanation   
The rotating wheel will precess due to gravitational torque, $m g s$ ( $I \omega_{0}$ moves in the direction of this gravitational torque; precession) (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1q5008_figure_1.png>`a).

$F$ is the applied force in the direction of precession (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1q5008_figure_1.png>`b). The applied torque is pointing vertically upward, so now $I \omega_{0}$ moves also upward.
