## Equipment   
*  Wooden block 
*  Pulley 
*  String 
*  Slotted masses
      
## Presentation   
The slotted mass is made so heavy that the block just doesnâ€™t move. Then you give a smash on the table and the block will start sliding and keep on sliding.    
  
## Explanation   
When the block just doesn't move, it means that $F_{f}$ is almost equal to $F_{f, \max }=\mu_{\text {stat }} F_{n}$ (see {numref}`Figure {number} <1k2009_figure_1>`).

``` 

A smash on the table means that the block is released from the table for a short moment (at least temporarily $F_{n}$ will be much smaller than $m_{A} g$ ) so A and B start moving. Since $A$ and $B$ continue to move, it means that $\mu_{k i n} F_{n}\left(=m_{B} g\right)$ is lower than $\mu_{\text {stat }} F_{n}$.   
  
## Remarks   
*  The ring for fixing the string can be moved vertically in order to maintain the pulling string horizontal when the block is moving. 
*  A wetted bottom of the block makes this demonstration somewhat easier.
